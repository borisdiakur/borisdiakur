### Hi

My name is Boris and I'm a frontend developer with a strong focus on accessibility. I advocate for open source, value readable code, separation of concerns, simplicity, pragmatism, knowledge sharing and a respectful interaction with anyone.

My main go-to tools these days are HTML, PostCSS, Tailwind CSS, Typescript and Vite.
